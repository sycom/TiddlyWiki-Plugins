! Introduction
The ''geolocation'' widget is used to collect geographic position of the browser running the wiki. For now position will be added the //point// (or //points// if there is more than one point) field of the target tiddler. Those fields may then be used with the [[Leaflet Map Plugin|https://sycom.github.io/TiddlyWiki-Plugins/#Leaflet%20plugin]], or whatever tool using geographic coordinates.

* The widget is not dependant from Leaflet Map Plugin (but is bundled in it). You may install it alone
* The widget will only work on //https// website, due to security limitation of the geolocation implemented in browsers

! Content and Attributes
The [[geolocation widget|$:/ext/modules/widgets/geolocation-widget.js]] will create a button to collect your browser's position. Any content within it is ignored.

| !Attribute | !Description | !Default |
|target |The tiddler (title) in which data will be stored |//current tiddler// |
|icon |The title of the icon used to dress up the button|$:/core/images/globe |
|text |The text displayed in the button (will overwrite the icon)|`undefined` |

More options will come later (//accuracy//, //object type//...).
