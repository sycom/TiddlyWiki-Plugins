The [[leaflet plugin|$:/plugins/sycom/leaflet]] is a very early attempt to integrate the [[leaflet|http://leafletjs.com/]] library lib in TiddlyWiki in order to display geographical purpose tiddlers. ''Be careful, entering wrong coordinates may cause unwanted behaviour''.

For now you can display an interactive map, select size, location and zoom, and background. You can also display data from a tiddler : point(s), polygon and/or polyline. Have a look at [[usage|$:/plugins/sycom/leaflet/usage]] and [[example|$:/plugins/sycom/leaflet/example]] if you want to test, and keep in mind that the plugin is very young and might be buggy...
