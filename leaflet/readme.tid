The [[leaflet plugin|$:/plugins/sycom/leaflet]] is work in progress integration of the [[leaflet|http://leafletjs.com/]] library lib in TiddlyWiki in order to display geographical purpose tiddlers. ''Be careful, entering wrong coordinates may cause unwanted behaviour''.

For now `<$leafmap />` widget displays an interactive map, select size, location and zoom, clustering distance, and background. You can display data  : geojson, point(s), polygon(s) and/or polyline(s) directly or calling [[GeoTiddler]](s). Tiddler can be called individually, by list or with a [[filter|Filters]].

Have a look at [[demo page on the web|http://sycom.github.io/TiddlyWiki-Plugins/#A%20plugin%20collection:%5B%5BA%20plugin%20collection%5D%5D%20%5B%5BLeaflet%20plugin%5D%5D]] or at local [[usage|$:/plugins/sycom/leaflet/usage]] and [[example|$:/plugins/sycom/leaflet/example]] informations if you want to test.

Keep in mind that the plugin might be buggy or imperfect. Please [[report any comment or issue|https://framagit.org/sycom/TiddlyWikiPlugins/issues]] on main repo. Source code at [[https://framagit.org/sycom/TiddlyWikiPlugins]] on framagit ([[framasoft|https://framasoft.org/]] gitlab instance) see `leaflet` branch for latest draft version.
