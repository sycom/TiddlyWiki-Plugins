!! a map with data on the go
very useful for fast mapping. All objects that might be embedded in GeoTiddler can be used here. Let's display a map with satellite imagery and

* a ''point'' at `6.5,19.72`
* a ''polyline'' at `6.4,19.7 6.6,19.74`

```
<$leafmap tile='sat'
	places='{"point":"6.5,19.72","polyline":"6.4,19.7 6.6,19.74"}'>
```

<$leafmap tile='sat'
	places='{"point":"6.5,19.72","polyline":"6.4,19.7 6.6,19.74"}'>
