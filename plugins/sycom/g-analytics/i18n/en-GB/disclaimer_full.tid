As many website do, this wiki uses [[Google Analytics|https://analytics.google.com]] (via the [[Google Analytics plugin|$:/plugins/sycom/g-analytics]]) to help analyse how much visitors use this site and where they come from. Google uses “[[cookies|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie]]”, which are small text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form.

Note also that as ''internal link tracker option is activated'' on this wiki, the tracker will send the title of each tiddler you're visiting (still anonymously though).

Your anonymity is safe here but you may wish to disable all tracking since data are sent to Google who may use them for marketing purpose. The plugin is compliant with [[Do Not Track|http://donottrack.us/]]. So,

* if you enable ''do not track'' option ''in your browser'' and reload the page the wiki will not collect nor send data any more. You may also use privacy extensions to control which site can track you. [[All About Do Not Track|https://allaboutdnt.com/]] website provide usefull informations about all this.
* some browsers enable do not track when using "private mode" ([[Firefox|http://firefox.com]] does). If you visit the wiki from those browsers in "private mode" no data will be sent either.
