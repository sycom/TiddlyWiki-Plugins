Not really a roadmap just a list for future development ideas. You'd better take a look at [[issues|https://framagit.org/sycom/TiddlyWiki-Plugins/boards]] on the repo. And add yours if you dare ;-)

* add a tool to draw shapes, lines and collect coordinates. Until this, You may use [[Draw for TiddlyWiki leaflet plugin|http://sycom.github.io/TiddlyWiki-Plugins/leafletDraw.html]]
* add categories options
* add text, title capabilities
* try a tiddler template based upon field presence to render data for all geoTiddler
* ...

* ~~try to put other types of pins (svg? icons?)~~ ''0.8.0'' : you may change markers via the //marker// option and design your own markers
* ~~add color(s) options~~ ''0.7.2'' : color can be set via //color// tiddler field or forced through //color// option
* ~~add a clustering functionality (at least for points)~~ ''0.7.0'' : each data group is know clustering points
* ~~add geoJSON tiddlers~~ ''0.6.0'' : added geojsontiddler rendering
