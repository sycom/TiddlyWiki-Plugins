The [font awesome sprites icons plugin](#$:/plugins/sycom/f-awesome) is an unreleased integration of the [font-awesome icons][f-a] library into TiddlyWiki.

It uses svg sprites library instead of classical font library which is **not as lightweight** as intended. This is the reason why I didn't released this one. You should prefer [the dive O plugin][diveOplugin] which is a brilliant integration of the woff library.
