# TiddlyWiki Plugins
this is a playing space for [TiddlyWiki][tiddlywiki] plugins. Try the [demo][demo] and drag drop the last release on the github page.

## Leaflet plugin - 0.5
The leaflet plugin is a very early attempt to integrate the [leaflet][leaflet] lib in TiddlyWiki in order to display geographical purpose tiddler.

For now you can display an interactive map, select size, location and zoom, and background. You can also display simple geographical data, even stored in metadata fields from tiddler(s) : point(s), polygon(s) and/or polyline(s).

See [demo online][demo] to learn more. Source code at [sycom/TiddlyWikiPlugins][repo] on framagit (gitlab instance) see `leaflet` branch for latest draft version.
